    #~ Human-readable constraints:
    #~   - valid W3C DID (https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-syntax)
    #~      - entire URI is ASCII: [a-zA-Z0-9._:%-]
    #~      - always starts "did:" (lower-case)

    #~      - remaining identifier can have any of the above chars, but can not end in ":"
    #~      - it seems that a bunch of ":" can be included, and don't need spaces between
    #~      - "%" is used only for "percent encoding" and must be followed by two hex characters (and thus can't end in "%")

=head1 NAME

At::Protocol::DID - AT Protocol DID Validation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use At::Protocol::DID qw[:all];
    try {
        ensureValidDid( 'did:method:val' );
    }
    catch($err) {
        ...; # do something about it
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The AT Protocol uses L<Decentralized Identifiers|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier> (DIDs) as
persistent, long-term account identifiers. DID is a W3C standard, with many standardized and proposed DID method
implementations.

This package aims to validate them.

=head1 Functions

You may import functions by name or with the C<:all> tag.

=head2 C<new( ... )>

Verifies a DID and creates a new object containing it.

    my $handle = At::Protocol::DID->new( 'did:web:blueskyweb.xyz' );

On success, an object is returned that will stringify to the DID itself.

=head2 C<ensureValidDid( ... )>

    ensureValidDid( 'did:plc:z72i7hdynmk6r22z27h6tvur' );

Validates a DID. Throws errors on failure and returns a true value on success.

=head2 C<ensureValidDidRegex( ... )>

    ensureValidDidRegex( 'did:method::nope' );

Validates a DID with cursory regex provided by the AT protocol designers. Throws errors on failure and returns a true
value on success.
